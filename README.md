## How to Run the App

npm install
npm run dev

## What I Focused On

1. Component architecture - specific folders, reusable components
2. State management - Implemented Zustand
3. Responsive design - Made a hook for different screens
4. Status management - color coded status and mapping enums to Part keys
5. Type safety - with TS

## What I Would Improve With More Time

1. Add routing
2. Replace mock data with real data
3. More attention to CSS
4. More optimizations with useMemo, useCallback
5. Implement AGGrid if we have a lot more data
